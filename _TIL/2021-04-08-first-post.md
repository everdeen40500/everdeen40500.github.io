This is my Gitblog.
I usually upload TIL.
You can check the TIL articles that I wrote in the TIL folder.

​```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
​```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
